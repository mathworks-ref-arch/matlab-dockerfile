## Changelog

### 2025.2 - October 15, 2025
- **Fixed**: Addressed issues to improve the quality and stability of `mpm`.

> **Note:**
> `mpm` was not updated on Intel Macs for 2025.2. When you download the latest version of `mpm` on Intel Macs, you get 2025.1.

### 2025.1 - April 2, 2025
- **Added**: Use the `--no-deps` option of `mpm download` to download only the specified products and omit product dependencies. Specify this option when all required dependencies have already been downloaded or are currently installed.

### 2024.4 - December 11, 2024
- **Added**: Support for installing IEC Certification Kit, DO Qualification Kit, and Simulink Code Inspector from source files downloaded using the interactive product installer, as described in [Download Products Without Installing](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/download-without-installing.html). You must have a license for these products to download them.
- **Added**: When you download products using `mpm download`, the downloaded folder now includes platform-specific versions of `mpm` that you can use to install products on target computers.

### 2024.3 - October 2, 2024
- **Added**: Use the `--inputfile` option of `mpm download` to download products by specifying options in an input file. Using this file, you can select the products and support packages you want to download without having to enter them at the command line.
- **Added**: Use the `--platforms` option of `mpm download` to download products for multiple platforms. Previously, `mpm download` downloaded products only for the platform of the computer performing the download.

### 2024.2.2 - August 14, 2024
- **Security:** Patched CVE-2023-45853.

### 2024.2.1 - July 24, 2024
- **Fixed:** Resolved an issue that causes `mpm` to fail on some Linux distributions.

### 2024.2 - July 17, 2024
- **Added**: Use `mpm download` to download products and support packages without installing them.
- **Added**: Install support packages that were downloaded using `mpm download`.
- **Added**: Support for installing IEC Certification Kit, DO Qualification Kit, and Simulink Code Inspector from a mounted ISO image. For an example, see [Install Products from Mounted ISO Image](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/mpminstall.html#mw_3a3793a5-4576-464b-adf9-24c714709e6c).
- **Changed**: `mpm` now omits installing products that are already installed instead of issuing an error.

### 2024.1.1 - March 27, 2024
- **Added:** Specify the `--no-jre` option that allows you to skip installing the default Java Runtime Environment (JRE) used by MATLAB and set a custom JRE instead. For information on which JREs are supported, see [Versions of OpenJDK Compatible with MATLAB by Release](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/openjdk.html) on the MathWorks website.
- **Changed:** Versioning changed from YYYY.MM.MINOR.MICRO to YYYY.MINOR.MICRO [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/).

### 2023.12.1 - December 14, 2023
- **Added:** Support for Windows
- **Added:** Support for macOS

### 2023.10.0.1 - October 26, 2023
- **Added:** Install hardware and software support packages.
- **Added:** Install required products automatically. For example, if you specify `--product Simulink`, then `mpm` installs both Simulink and the required product MATLAB.
- **Added:** Install products by specifying options in an input file.

### 2023.9 - September 13, 2023

- **Fixed:** Resolved an issue that prevented installation of R2023b.
