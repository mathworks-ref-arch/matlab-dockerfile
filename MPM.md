# MATLAB Package Manager

## Description

MATLAB Package Manager (**mpm**) is a command line package manager for MathWorks products. It enables you to install MATLAB, Simulink, and toolboxes programmatically on Linux, or as part of a Dockerfile. mpm provides options to specify the release, destination, products, and toolboxes for the resulting MATLAB installation. By default, mpm does not include MATLAB documentation and examples in the MATLAB installation.

Example usage:

    mpm install --release=R2023a --destination=/home/username/matlab --products MATLAB Simulink Deep_Learning_Toolbox Parallel_Computing_Toolbox

## Download MATLAB Package Manager

To get the latest version of mpm, run the following command in a terminal. You need wget installed.

    wget https://www.mathworks.com/mpm/glnxa64/mpm

Before you run mpm, give the downloaded file executable permissions:

    chmod +x mpm

## Usage

    mpm install --release=<release> --destination=<destination> [--products] <product1> <product2>

### Commands

- help - Show help and exit
- install - Install selected products

### Options

Global options:

    -h [ --help ]         Show help and exit
    -v [ --version ]      Show version and exit

Install options:
  --release arg         Specify the MATLAB release to install.
  --doc                 Install documentation. Supported in R2022b and older 
                        releases only. To install documentation in a newer 
                        release, use the install-doc command.
  --source arg          Specify the full path to the downloaded product files.
  --destination arg     Specify the full path to the destination where you want
                        to install MATLAB, for example /home/username/matlab 
                        (default is /usr/share/matlab).
  --products arg        Specify the list of products to install using product 
                        names separated by spaces. Replace spaces within names 
                        with underscores. For example: MATLAB Simulink 
                        Deep_Learning_Toolbox Parallel_Computing_Toolbox.
  --no-gpu              Do not include GPU libraries when installing products. 
                        The no-gpu argument is supported in R2023a and newer 
                        releases only.

Install-doc options:
  --matlabroot arg      Specify the full path to the folder where MATLAB and 
                        other products are installed.
  --source arg          Specify the full path to the mounted documentation ISO.
  --destination arg     Specify the full path to the folder where you want to 
                        install the documentation.

### Example

No documentation and examples:

    mpm install --release=R2023a --destination=/home/username/matlab --products MATLAB Deep_Learning_Toolbox Parallel_Computing_Toolbox

Include documentation and examples:

    mpm install --release=R2023a --destination=/home/username/matlab --products MATLAB Deep_Learning_Toolbox Parallel_Computing_Toolbox
    
    mpm install-doc --matlabroot=/home/username/matlab

## Product Availability

**mpm** can install most MathWorks products. [See the MathWorks website](https://www.mathworks.com/products.html) for the full list of available products and their names. Replace spaces with underscores when specifying product names with the `--products` option."
