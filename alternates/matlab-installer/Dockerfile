# Create a self-contained MATLAB installer using these instructions:
#
# https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/download-only.html
#
# You must be an administrator on your license to complete this workflow.
# You can run the installer on any platform to create a self-contained MATLAB installer.
# When creating the installer, on the "Folder and Platform Selection" screen, select "Linux (64-bit)".
#
# Put the installer in a directory called matlab-install.
# Move that matlab-install folder to be in the same folder as this Dockerfile.

# Add the extracted MATLAB installer to the image
COPY matlab-install /matlab-install/

# Copy the file matlab-install/installer_input.txt into the same folder as the
# Dockerfile and edit this file to specify the products that you want to install.
# Note that you must change the following set of parameters in the file:
#   fileInstallationKey
#   agreeToLicense=yes
#   Uncomment products you want to install

# For installs prior to R2020a, uncomment one of the following 2 ways of adding the license file.
# If you use a release of MATLAB after, and including, R2020a both methods can be commented out.
# If this is done, either mount a license file or specify a license server at runtime.
# You must also comment out the commands directly after the install relating to the license file.

# The first way to add a license file is to use the LICENSE_SERVER argument to automatically
# generate a valid network.lic file.
# Print this file out to verify that it has been generated successfully.
