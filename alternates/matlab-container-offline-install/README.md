# Install MATLAB and Add-Ons in Containers in an Offline Environment

The Dockerfiles in this subfolder show you how to build and customize a Docker&reg; container for MATLAB&reg; and its toolboxes, using the [MATLAB Package Manager (*mpm*)](../../MPM.md) in an offline environment where *mpm* is not able to download the toolbox installation files. Use this solution only if you need to install MATLAB, toolboxes, and support packages in an air-gapped environment. Otherwise, use the [`Dockerfile`](../../Dockerfile) in the top-level repository.

The solution uses two Docker images. The first image (archive image) contains the installation files that are required by *mpm* to install from source. The second image (product image) uses the archive image to get the installation files for MATLAB, toolboxes and support packages that you want to install.

### Requirements

* [A Running Network License Manager for MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/administer-network-licenses.html)
  * For more information, see [Use the Network License Manager](../../README.md#use-the-network-license-manager)
* Docker >= 20.10

## Build Instructions

### Get the Dockerfiles

Access the Dockerfiles either by directly downloading this repository from GitHub&reg;, or by cloning this repository and then navigating to the appropriate subfolder. You must have a working internet connection to perform this action.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile.git
cd matlab-dockerfile/alternates/matlab-container-offline-install
```

### Build the Archive Docker Image
>
> [!WARNING]
> You must run this step in an online environment.

You can then store the generated Docker build and copy it to the offline or air-gapped environment for the next step.

Build the archive image with a name and tag.

```bash
docker build -t mpm-archive:R2024b -f archive.Dockerfile .
```

By default, the [archive.Dockerfile](archive.Dockerfile) downloads the latest available MATLAB release without any additional toolboxes or products.

To customize the build of the archive image, refer to [Customize the Archive Docker Image](#customize-the-archive-docker-image).

### Build the Product Docker Image

To run this step in an offline or air-gapped environment, you need:

* The [mathworks/matlab-deps](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab-deps) image in your local Docker registry.
* The mpm-archive image in your local Docker registry.
* A Docker environment with [BuildKit enabled](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/#getting-started).

Build a container with a name and tag.

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t matlab-from-source:R2024b .
```

To customize the build of the product image, refer to [Customize the Product Docker Image](#customize-the-product-docker-image).

## Customization Instructions

Follow these instructions if you want to customize the build of the archive and product Docker images.

### Customize the Archive Docker Image

The [archive.Dockerfile](archive.Dockerfile) supports the following Docker build-time variables:

| Argument Name | Default value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| [MATLAB_RELEASE](#build-an-archive-image-for-a-different-release-of-matlab) | R2024b | The MATLAB release to install, for example, `R2023b`. |
| [MATLAB_PRODUCT_LIST](#build-an-archive-image-with-a-specific-set-of-products) | MATLAB | Products to install as a space-separated list. For more information, see [MPM.md](../../MPM.md). For example: `MATLAB Simulink Deep_Learning_Toolbox Fixed-Point_Designer` |

Use these arguments with the `docker build` command to customize your image.
Alternatively, you can change the default values for these arguments directly in the [archive.Dockerfile](archive.Dockerfile).

#### Build an Archive Image for a Different Release of MATLAB

For example, to build an archive image for MATLAB R2023b installation files, use the following command.

```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_RELEASE=R2023b -t mpm-archive:R2023b -f archive.Dockerfile .
```

#### Build an Archive Image with a specific set of products

For example, to build an image with MATLAB and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox&trade; installation files, use this command.

```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_PRODUCT_LIST="MATLAB Statistics_and_Machine_Learning_Toolbox" -t mpm-archive:R2024b -f archive.Dockerfile .
```

### Customize the Product Docker Image

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) supports the following Docker build-time variables:

| Argument Name | Default value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| [MATLAB_RELEASE](#build-an-image-for-a-different-release-of-matlab) | R2024b | The MATLAB release you want to install, in lower-case. For example: `R2022a`. :warning: This release must match the `MATLAB_RELEASE` you use to build the archive image. |
| [MATLAB_PRODUCT_LIST](#build-an-image-with-a-specific-set-of-products) | MATLAB | Products to install as a space-separated list. For more information, see [MPM.md](../../MPM.md). For example: `MATLAB Simulink Deep_Learning_Toolbox Fixed-Point_Designer`. The list of products to install must be a subset of the installation files available in the archive image. |
| [MATLAB_INSTALL_LOCATION](#build-an-image-with-matlab-installed-to-a-specific-location) | /opt/matlab/R2024b | The path to install MATLAB. |
| [ARCHIVE_BASE_IMAGE](#build-an-image-from-a-different-archive) | mpm-archive:R2024b | The name of the Docker&reg; image containing the product installation files. |
| [LICENSE_SERVER](#build-an-image-configured-to-use-a-license-server) | *unset* | The port and hostname of the machine that is running the Network License Manager, using the `port@hostname` syntax. For example: `27000@MyServerName` |

Use these arguments with the `docker build` command to customize your image.
Alternatively, you can change the default values for these arguments directly in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

### Build an Image for a Different Release of MATLAB

For example, to build an image for MATLAB R2023b, use the following command.

```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_RELEASE=R2023b --build-arg ARCHIVE_BASE_IMAGE=mpm-archive:R2023b -t matlab-from-source:R2023b .
```

Ensure that the release of the archive base image you set in `ARCHIVE_BASE_IMAGE` matches the one in `MATLAB_RELEASE`.

### Build an Image with a Specific Set of Products

For example, to build an image with MATLAB and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, use this command.

```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_PRODUCT_LIST="MATLAB Statistics_and_Machine_Learning_Toolbox" -t matlab-stats-from-source:R2024b .
```

### Build an Image with MATLAB Installed to a Specific Location

For example, to build an image with MATLAB installed at `/opt/matlab`, use this command.

```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_INSTALL_LOCATION="/opt/matlab" -t matlab-from-source:R2024b .
```

### Build an Image from a Different Archive

For example, to build an image using a different archive image, use the following command.

```bash
docker build  --build-arg ARCHIVE_BASE_IMAGE=my-archive -t matlab-from-source:R2024b .
```

#### Build an Image Configured to Use a License Server

Including the license server information with the `docker build` command means you do not have to pass it when running the container.

```bash
# Build container with the License Server.
docker build --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName -t matlab-from-source:R2024b .

# Run the container, without needing to pass license information.
docker run --init --rm matlab-from-source:R2024b -batch ver
```
