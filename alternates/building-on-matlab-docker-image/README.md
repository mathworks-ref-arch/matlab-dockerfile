# Building on MATLAB Docker Image

The Dockerfile in this subfolder builds on the [MATLAB Container Image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab)
by installing MATLAB&reg; toolboxes and support packages using [MATLAB Package Manager](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md) (`mpm`).

Use the Dockerfile as an example of how to build a custom image that contains the features of the MATLAB image on Docker&reg; Hub.
These features include accessing the dockerized MATLAB through a browser, batch mode, or an interactive command prompt.
For details of the features in the image, see [MATLAB Container Image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab).

### Requirements
* Docker

## Build Instructions

### Get the Dockerfile

Access the Dockerfile either by directly downloading this repository from GitHub&reg;,
or by cloning this repository and
then navigating to the appropriate subfolder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile.git
cd matlab-dockerfile/alternates/building-on-matlab-docker-image
```

### Quick Start
Build a container with a name and tag.
```bash
docker build -t matlab_with_add_ons:R2025b .
```

You can then run the container with the `batch` option. Test the container by running an example MATLAB command, such as `ver`, to display the installed toolboxes.
```bash
docker run --init --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab_with_add_ons:R2025b -batch ver
```
You can check the installed support packages using the MATLAB command `matlabshared.supportpkg.getInstalled`.

You can also run the container with the `browser` option to access MATLAB in a browser.
```bash
docker run --init --rm -it -p 8888:8888 matlab_with_add_ons:R2025b -browser
```
For more information, see [Run the Container](#run-the-container).

## Customize the Image
### Customize Products to Install Using MATLAB Package Manager
This Dockerfile installs any specified products
into the MATLAB installation on the MATLAB Docker Hub image.

To customize the build, either pass a list of products into the `ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS`
argument when building the Docker image, or edit the default value of that argument in the Dockerfile.
The `ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS` argument must be a space-separated list surrounded by quotation marks.
By default, `ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS` includes example products, which you can replace.
For example, to build an image containing MATLAB and the Deep Learning Toolbox&trade;, use this command.
```bash
docker build --build-arg ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS="Deep_Learning_Toolbox" -t matlab_with_add_ons:R2025b .
```

For a successful build, include at least one product.
`mpm` automatically installs any toolboxes and support packages
required by the products specified in `ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS`.
For more information, see [MATLAB Package Manager](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md).

You can modify the products argument of `mpm`, but not the destination folder default value, which is
set to match the default value of the MATLAB image on Docker Hub. If you modify the default value for the `--destination` argument, the build might fail.

### Docker Build-Time Variables
The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) supports the Docker build-time variables listed in the table.

| Argument Name | Default value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| [MATLAB_RELEASE](#build-an-image-for-a-different-release-of-matlab) | R2025b | MATLAB release to install, for example, `R2023b`.|
| [ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS](#customize-products-to-install-using-matlab-package-manager-mpm) | `Symbolic_Math_Toolbox Deep_Learning_Toolbox_Model_for_ResNet-50_Network` | Space-separated list of toolboxes and support packages to install. For more details, see  [MATLAB Package Manager](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md).|
| [LICENSE_SERVER](#build-an-image-with-license-server-information) | *unset* | Port and hostname of a machine that is running a Network License Manager, using the `port@hostname` syntax, for example, `27000@MyServerName`. To use this build argument, the corresponding lines must be uncommented in the Dockerfile. |

Use these arguments with the `docker build` command to customize the image.
Alternatively, change the default values for these arguments directly in the Dockerfile.

### Build an Image for a Different MATLAB Release

For example, to build an image for MATLAB R2022b, use this command.
```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_RELEASE=R2022b -t matlab_with_add_ons:R2022b .
```

To build an image for MATLAB R2022b with Deep Learning Toolbox and Parallel Computing Toolbox&trade;, use this command.
```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_RELEASE=R2022b --build-arg ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS="Deep_Learning_Toolbox Parallel_Computing_Toolbox" -t matlab_with_add_ons:R2022b .
```
For supported releases see [MATLAB Container Image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab).
### Build an Image with License Server Information
If you include the license server information with the `docker build` command, you do not need to pass the information while running the container.
To use this build argument, uncomment the corresponding lines in the Dockerfile.
If the lines are uncommented, `$LICENSE_SERVER` must be a valid license
server or the browser mode will not start successfully.

Build container with the license server.
```bash
docker build -t matlab_with_add_ons:R2025b --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName .
```

Run the container, without needing to pass license information.
```bash
docker run --init matlab_with_add_ons:R2025b -batch ver
```
## Run the Container
The Docker container you build using this Dockerfile inherits run options from its base image.
See the documentation for the base image, [MATLAB Container Image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab) (hosted on Docker Hub) for instructions on how to use the base image features. The features include interacting with MATLAB using a web browser, batch mode, or an interactive command prompt, as well as how to provide license information when running the container.
Run the commands provided in the instructions using the name of the Docker image that you build using this Dockerfile.
