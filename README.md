# Create a MATLAB Container Image

This repository shows you how to build and customize a Docker&reg; container for MATLAB&reg; and its toolboxes, using the [MATLAB Package Manager (*mpm*)](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md). 

You can use this container image as a scalable and reproducible method to deploy and test your MATLAB code.

You can also download pre-built images based on this Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/pkgs/container/matlab-dockerfile%2Fmatlab).

### Requirements
* [A Running Network License Manager for MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/administer-network-licenses.html)
    * For more information see section on [Use the Network License Manager](#use-the-network-license-manager) 
* LinuxÂ® Operating System
* Docker
* Git

## Build Instructions

### Get Sources
 
```bash
# Clone this repository to your machine
git clone https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile.git

# Navigate to the downloaded folder
cd matlab-dockerfile
```

### Build & Run Docker Image
```bash
# Build container with a name and tag of your choice.
docker build -t matlab:r2022b .

# Run the container. Test the container by running an example MATLAB command such as ver.
docker run --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:r2022b -batch ver
```
The example command `ver` displays the version number of MATLAB and other installed products. For more information, see [ver](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ver.html). For more information on running the container, see the section on [Run the Container](#run-the-container).

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) defaults to building a container for MATLAB R2022b.

## Customize the Image
### Customize Products to Install Using MATLAB Package Manager (mpm)
The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) defaults to installing MATLAB with no additional toolboxes or products into the `/opt/matlab` folder.

To customize the build, edit the **mpm** commands in the Dockerfile's usage. You can choose products, release, and destination folder.

Specify products to install as a space-separated list with the `--products` flag, and specify an install path with the `--destination` flag. For more information, see [MPM.md](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md).

For example, to build a container with `MATLAB` and `Deep Learning Toolbox` installed under the path `/tmp/matlab`, change the corresponding lines in the Dockerfile as follows:

```Dockerfile
RUN wget -q https://www.mathworks.com/mpm/glnxa64/mpm && \ 
    chmod +x mpm && \
    ./mpm install \
        --release=${MATLAB_RELEASE} \
        --destination=/tmp/matlab \
        --products MATLAB Deep_Learning_Toolbox && \
    rm -f mpm /tmp/mathworks_root.log && \
    ln -s /tmp/matlab/bin/matlab /usr/local/bin/matlab
```

### Customize MATLAB Release and License Server
The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) supports the following Docker build-time variables:

| Argument Name | Default value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| [MATLAB_RELEASE](#build-an-image-for-a-different-release-of-matlab) | r2022b | The MATLAB release you want to install. Must be lower-case, for example: `r2019b`.|
| [LICENSE_SERVER](#build-an-image-with-license-server-information) | *unset* | The port and hostname of the machine that is running the Network License Manager, using the `port@hostname` syntax. For Example: `27000@MyServerName` |

Use these arguments with the the `docker build` command to customize your image.
Alternatively, you can change the default values for these arguments directly in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile).

#### Build an Image for a Different Release of MATLAB

```bash
# Builds an image for MATLAB R2019b
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_RELEASE=r2019b -t matlab:r2019b .
```

#### Build an Image with License Server Information
Including the license server information with the docker build command avoids having to pass it when running the container.
```bash
# Build container with the License Server
docker build -t matlab:r2022b --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName .

# Run the container, without needing to pass license information
docker run matlab:r2022b -batch ver
```

## Use the Network License Manager
This container requires a Network License Manager to license and run MATLAB. You will need either the port and hostname of the Network License Manager or a `network.lic` file.

**Step 1**: Contact your system administrator who can provide one of:

1. The address to your server, and the port it is running on. 
    For example: `27000@MyServerName.example.com`

2. A `network.lic` file which contains the following lines:
    ```bash
    # Sample network.lic
    SERVER MyServerName.example.com <optional-mac-address> 27000
    USE_SERVER
    ```

3. A `license.dat` file. Open the `license.dat` file, find the `SERVER` line, and either extract the `port@hostname` or create a `network.lic` file by copying the `SERVER` line and adding a `USE_SERVER` line below it.

    ```bash
    # snippet from sample license.dat
    SERVER MyServerName.example.com <mac-address> 27000
    ```
---
**Step 2**: Use `port@hostname` or `network.lic` file with either the `docker build` **or** `docker run` commands.

With the `docker build` command, either:

- Specify the `LICENSE_SERVER` build-arg.

    ```bash
    # Example
    docker build -t matlab:r2022b --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName .
    ```
- Use the `network.lic` file:
    1. Place the `network.lic` file in the same folder as the Dockerfile.
    1. Uncomment the line `COPY network.lic /opt/matlab/licenses/` in the Dockerfile.
    1. Run the docker build command **without** the `LICENSE_SERVER` build-arg:

    ```bash
    # Example
    docker build -t matlab:r2022b .
    ```
    
With the `docker run` command, use the `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable. For example:

```bash
docker run --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:r2022b -batch ver
```

## Run the Container
If you did not provide the license server information while building the image, then you must provide it when running the container. Set this environment variable `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` using the `-e` flag with the  network license manager's location as `port@hostname`.

```bash
# Start MATLAB, print version information, and exit:
docker run --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:r2022b -batch ver
```

You can run the container **without** specifying `MLM_LICENSE_FILE`, if you provided the license server information when building the image, as shown in the examples below.

### Run MATLAB in an Interactive Command Prompt
To start the container and run MATLAB in an interactive command prompt, execute:
```bash
docker run -it --rm matlab:r2022b
```
### Run MATLAB in Batch Mode
To start the container, run a MATLAB command and exit, execute:
```bash
# Container runs the command RAND in MATLAB and exits.
docker run --rm matlab:r2022b -batch rand
```

### Run MATLAB with Startup Options
To override the default behavior of the container and run MATLAB with any set of arguments, such as `-logfile`, execute:
```bash
docker run -it --rm matlab:r2022b -logfile "logfilename.log"
```
