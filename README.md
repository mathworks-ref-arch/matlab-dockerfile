# Create MATLAB Container Image

This repository shows you how to build and customize a Docker&reg; container for MATLAB&reg; and its toolboxes, using the [MATLAB Package Manager](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md) (`mpm`). You can use this container image as a scalable and reproducible method to deploy and test your MATLAB code.

Use the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in this top-level repository if you want a lightweight and simple way to create a MATLAB container image. You can also download prebuilt images based on the Dockerfile from [here](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/pkgs/container/matlab-dockerfile%2Fmatlab).

For alternative resources, see the [**alternates folder**](alternates) that contains the following Dockerfiles:

* The Dockerfile in [matlab-installer](alternates/matlab-installer) uses the MATLAB installer rather than `mpm` to install MATLAB in the container. This allows you to install toolboxes that are not currently supported by mpm. Use this Dockerfile if you prefer using the MATLAB installer workflow, instead of `mpm`.
* The Dockerfile in [building-on-matlab-docker-image](alternates/building-on-matlab-docker-image) shows you how to build on top of the [MATLAB Container Image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab). Use this Dockerfile if you want to install extra toolboxes on top of the `mathworks/matlab` container image. This Dockerfile contains the features of the MATLAB image on Docker Hub, allowing you to access the dockerised MATLAB through a browser, batch mode, or an interactive command prompt.
* The Dockerfile in [non-interactive](alternates/non-interactive) allows you run MATLAB in non-interactive environments. This Dockerfile requires that you have a MATLAB batch licensing token to license MATLAB in the container. Use this Dockerfile in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines or other automated environments where interactive licensing is not possible.
* The Dockerfile in [matlab-container-offline-install](alternates/matlab-container-offline-install/) shows you how to build and customize a Docker container for MATLAB and its toolboxes in an offline environment. Use this Dockerfile if you must build your container image in an offline environment.

### Requirements

* [A running network license manager for MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/administer-network-licenses.html) â€” For more information, see [Using the Network License Manager](#use-the-network-license-manager).
* Docker.

## Build Instructions

### Get Sources

Access the Dockerfile either by directly downloading this repository from GitHub&reg;,
or by cloning this repository and
then navigating to the appropriate folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile.git
cd matlab-dockerfile
```

### Build and Run Docker Image

Build container with a name and tag of your choice.

```bash
docker build -t matlab:R2024b .
```

Run the container. Test the container by running an example MATLAB command, such as `ver`.

```bash
docker run --init --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:R2024b -batch ver
```

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) defaults to building a container for MATLAB R2024b.

The example command `ver` displays the version number of MATLAB and other installed products. For more information, see [`ver`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ver.html). For more information on running the container, see the [Run the Container](#run-the-container) section.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `--init` flag in the `docker run` command to ensure that the container stops gracefully when a `docker stop` or `docker kill` command is issued.
> For more information, see these links:

> * [Blog post on the usage of init](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/docker-init-parameter)

## Customize the Image

By default, the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) installs the latest available MATLAB release without any additional toolboxes or products in the `/opt/matlab/${MATLAB_RELEASE}` folder.

Use the options below to customize your build.

### Customize MATLAB Release, MATLAB Product List, MATLAB Install Location, and License Server

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) supports these Docker build-time variables:

| Argument Name | Default value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [MATLAB_RELEASE](#build-an-image-for-a-different-release-of-matlab) | R2024b | MATLAB release to install, for example, `R2023b`.|
| [MATLAB_PRODUCT_LIST](#build-an-image-with-a-specific-set-of-products) | MATLAB | Space-separated list of products to install, for example, `MATLAB Simulink Deep_Learning_Toolbox Fixed-Point_Designer`. For more information, see [MPM.md](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md).|
| [MATLAB_INSTALL_LOCATION](#build-an-image-with-matlab-installed-to-a-specific-location) | /opt/matlab/R2024b | Path to install MATLAB. |
| [LICENSE_SERVER](#build-an-image-configured-to-use-a-license-server) | *unset* | Port and hostname of the machine that is running the network license manager, using the `port@hostname` syntax. For example: `27000@MyServerName` |

Use these arguments with the the `docker build` command to customize your image.
Alternatively, you can change the default values for these arguments directly in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile).

#### Build an Image for a Different MATLAB Release

For example, to build an image for MATLAB R2019b, use this command.

```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_RELEASE=R2019b -t matlab:R2019b .
```

#### Build an Image with a Specific Set of Products

For example, to build an image with MATLAB and Simulink&reg;, use this command.

```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_PRODUCT_LIST='MATLAB Simulink' -t matlab:R2024b .
```

#### Build an Image with MATLAB Installed to a Specific Location

For example, to build an image with MATLAB installed at /opt/matlab, use this command.

```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_INSTALL_LOCATION='/opt/matlab' -t matlab:R2024b .
```

#### Build an Image Configured to Use a License Server

Including the license server information with the `docker build` command means you do not have to pass it when running the container.

```bash
# Build container with the license server.
docker build --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName -t matlab:R2024b .

# Run the container without needing to pass license information.
docker run --init --rm matlab:R2024b -batch ver
```

## Use the Network License Manager

This container requires a network license manager to license and run MATLAB. You need either the port and hostname of the network license manager or a `network.lic` file.

**Step 1**: Contact your system administrator, who can provide one of the following:

* The address to your server, and the port it is running on, for example, `27000@MyServerName.example.com`

* A `network.lic` file containing these lines.

    ```bash
    # Sample network.lic
    SERVER MyServerName.example.com <optional-mac-address> 27000
    USE_SERVER
    ```

* A `license.dat` file. Open the `license.dat` file, find the `SERVER` line, and either extract the `port@hostname`, or create a `network.lic` file by copying the `SERVER` line and adding a `USE_SERVER` line below it.

    ```bash
    # Snippet from sample license.dat
    SERVER MyServerName.example.com <mac-address> 27000
    ```

---
**Step 2**: Use `port@hostname` or the `network.lic` file with either the `docker build` **or** the `docker run` command.

With the `docker build` command, either:

* Specify the `LICENSE_SERVER` build-arg.

    ```bash
    # Example
    docker build -t matlab:R2024b --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName .
    ```

* Use the `network.lic` file.
    1. Place the `network.lic` file in the same folder as the Dockerfile.
    1. Uncomment the line `COPY network.lic /opt/matlab/licenses/` in the Dockerfile.
    1. Run the `docker build` command **without** the `LICENSE_SERVER` build-arg:

    ```bash
    # Example
    docker build -t matlab:R2024b .
    ```

With the `docker run` command, use the `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable.

```bash
docker run --init --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:R2024b -batch ver
```

## Run the Container

If you did not provide the license server information when building the image, then provide it when running the container. Set the environment variable `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` using the `-e` flag, with the  network license manager's location in the format `port@hostname`.

```bash
# Start MATLAB, print version information, and exit.
docker run --init --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:R2024b -batch ver
```

You can run the container **without** specifying `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` if you provided the license server information when building the image, as shown in the examples below.

### Run MATLAB in an Interactive Command Prompt

To start the container and run MATLAB in an interactive command prompt, use this command.

```bash
docker run --init -it --rm matlab:R2024b
```

### Run MATLAB in Batch Mode

To start the container, run a MATLAB command, and then exit, use this command.

```bash
# Container runs the command RAND in MATLAB and exits.
docker run --init --rm matlab:R2024b -batch rand
```

### Run MATLAB with Startup Options

To override the default behavior of the container and run MATLAB with any set of arguments, such as `-logfile`, use this command.

```bash
docker run --init -it --rm matlab:R2024b -logfile "logfilename.log"
```

To learn more, see the documentation: [Commonly Used Startup Options](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/commonly-used-startup-options.html).
